### Exploring microbial diversity using portable technology for in situ analysis.
In-situ DNA extraction system to accessing microbial diversity in the Red Sea microbiomes

In this project, we aimed to explore the microbial diversity and taxonomy composition of three distinct microbial ecosystems in the shore of the Red Sea using a field-deployable automated DNA extraction system, comparing with a conventional lab-based kit.

For metagenomic analysis we have 72 samples of Coral and Mangroves and one positive control. 

For 16S, 75 samples the workflow used is [epi2me-labs/wf-metagenomics](https://github.com/epi2me-labs/wf-metagenomics)
